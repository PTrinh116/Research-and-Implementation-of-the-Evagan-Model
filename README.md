 This project is based on the paper "EVAGAN: Evasion Generative Adversarial Network for Low Data Regimes", where we implement the Evagan model for network intrusion detection.

## Datasets
The model is trained using three datasets:

ISCX-2014
CIC-2017
CIC-2018
## Training & Evaluation
Each model is trained for a defined number of epochs on the training set and evaluated on the test set. Performance is measured using the following metrics:
GEN VALIDITY
FAKE BOT EVA
REAL NORMAL EST
REAL BOT EVA
